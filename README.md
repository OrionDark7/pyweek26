## About the game and PyWeek

This game was originally a solo entry for [PyWeek 26](https://pyweek.org/26), which ran from 21 Oct 2018 to 28 Oct 2018. The game was released on 27 Oct 2018 (in my local timezone). The game tied for 4th Place out of all the Solo entries and ranked 3rd Place in the Fun Category of all Solo Entries.
